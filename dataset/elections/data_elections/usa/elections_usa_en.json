The central focus is to unleash domestic energy production across all sources, including oil, natural gas, and nuclear, by lifting restrictions to immediately lower costs. This approach includes reining in wasteful federal spending, cutting burdensome regulations that harm households, and securing the border to reduce upward pressure on housing, education, and healthcare costs. A foreign policy focused on stability will also aim to lower commodity prices by reducing geopolitical risk. Thus, this would make it possible to quickly bring down prices, tackle the cost-of-living crisis, and ensure long-term economic security."

To tackle the housing shortage, the priority is to build 3 million new affordable homes and rentals, facilitated by a $40 billion innovation fund and tax incentives for developers. Financial relief would be provided through an expanded child tax credit, down-payment assistance of up to $25,000 for first-time homebuyers, and caps on prescription drug costs. Thus, this would make it possible to increase economic security and reduce the financial strain on American families."

The effective approach is to increase transparency, promote greater choice and competition among providers, and expand access to new, affordable healthcare options. A central focus must be on protecting vital programs for seniors, ensuring they receive necessary care without excessive costs, and securing these programs' financial stability for the future. Support should also be directed toward specific family services like prenatal care, birth control access, and fertility treatments.

The right approach is to implement direct cost-control measures, including a universal cap on annual prescription drug expenses at $2,000 and a $35 monthly limit on insulin. To achieve this, the enhanced tax credits that lower insurance premiums would be made permanent, and Medicaid expansion would be extended to the remaining states. Furthermore, a critical priority is to cancel existing medical debt and permanently ban it from being included in credit reports. Thus, this would make it possible to significantly lower healthcare expenses and alleviate the financial burden of medical care for all Americans."

The priority should be to streamline the permitting process and cut burdensome regulations to lower energy costs for families and businesses. Environmental stewardship should focus on genuine conservation efforts and the preservation of natural treasures, rather than on programs that hinder economic activity.

This industrial strategy would include doubling the number of registered apprenticeships to develop a skilled workforce for these emerging sectors. The goal is to achieve a carbon-neutral power sector by 2030 and a net-zero economy by 2045, while holding corporate polluters accountable for environmental damage.Thus, this would make it possible to secure global leadership in green technology, spur broad-based economic growth, and lower energy costs for families."

This involves strengthening alliances by ensuring that allies meet their financial obligations to our common defense, with a clear goal of restoring peace in Europe and the Middle East. A key priority is to revive the domestic industrial base, guaranteeing that critical defense equipment is produced within the country.

The central focus must be on upholding international rules and norms, standing with allies against authoritarian powers, and managing strategic competition, especially with China, to ensure American interests prevail in the 21st century. This involves providing unwavering support for nations defending their sovereignty, such as Ukraine, and ensuring key partners, like Israel, have the ability to defend themselves, while also prioritizing humanitarian aid and diplomatic solutions for civilian populations. Thus, this would make it possible to maintain global stability, protect American security interests, and champion democracy without unilateral retreat."

The priority is to restore strict enforcement policies, complete physical wall construction, and deploy advanced technology alongside military resources to block cross-border threats. A decisive approach involves launching a large-scale deportation operation for those illegally present, starting with dangerous criminals, while simultaneously cutting federal funding to jurisdictions that obstruct federal immigration laws. Legal immigration must shift entirely to a merit-based system that prioritizes economic contribution over family chains, accompanied by rigorous vetting to ensure entrants align with national values. Thus, this would make it possible to restore order, end the current crisis, and ensure the system exclusively serves the national interest."

The right approach is to increase resources at the border by hiring thousands of new border patrol agents, deploying advanced technology for surveillance and fentanyl detection, and increasing penalties for repeat border crossers. Concurrently, the asylum process would be managed by increasing the number of asylum officers and judges to address backlogs efficiently, while barring those who cross unlawfully between ports of entry from receiving asylum. For those already in the country, the priority is creating an earned pathway to citizenship, particularly for those who arrived as children. This comprehensive strategy also involves addressing the root causes of migration through private sector investment and diplomatic partnerships in Central America. Thus, this would make it possible to secure the border, uphold American laws, and create a more just and efficient immigration system."

The right approach is to dissolve the federal Department of Education and return all authority and funding to the states, allowing them to tailor programs to their communities. A central focus should be on implementing universal school choice to give families control over their children's education and ensuring curricula prioritize fundamental knowledge over political indoctrination. To address college affordability, the creation of drastically more affordable alternatives to traditional four-year degrees should be supported, while systemic reforms, such as firing partisan accreditors, aim to drive down tuition costs. Thus, this would make it possible to create a more effective, responsive, and financially accessible education system that prepares students for successful careers without incurring overwhelming debt."

The right approach is to significantly invest in the public school system by increasing funding for Title I schools, which serve low-income communities, and raising teacher salaries to close the pay gap with comparably educated professionals. This includes a federal investment to provide the average teacher with a substantial raise, with a three-to-one federal match for state contributions. To address higher education costs, the priority is to make community college tuition-free and expand access to Public Service Loan Forgiveness for those in vital professions. Thus, this would make it possible to ensure equitable access to quality education from early childhood through higher learning and relieve the burden of student debt for millions of Americans."

The right of law-abiding citizens to own firearms must be uncompromisingly defended. The effective approach is to empower law enforcement by replenishing police departments and restoring common-sense policing practices. The focus should be on decisively targeting criminal elements by crushing gang violence, dismantling drug cartels, and ensuring violent offenders are incarcerated. For educational settings, the priority is hardening schools to prevent attacks and overhauling discipline to immediately remove violent students. Thus, this would make it possible to reduce violence and restore order by holding criminals accountable, rather than infringing on the constitutional rights of peaceful citizens."

Key priorities include reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, establishing universal background checks for all firearm sales, and promoting state-level adoption of red flag laws, which allow for the temporary removal of firearms from individuals deemed a danger to themselves or others. To achieve this, the focus will also be on requiring the safe storage of firearms to prevent access by minors and those at risk.
